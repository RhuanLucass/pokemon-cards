# Pokémon Slider - MapaDev Week Project

During the MapaDev Week, a simple project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JS by Dev em Dobro. The aim was to display interactive Pokémon cards containing information about the creatures. To enhance the project, I decided to implement the PokeAPI for the automatic filling of this data.

## Project Details

The project is a web application that showcases interactive Pokémon cards. Upon accessing the page, a randomly selected initial Pokémon with some of its abilities is displayed. Additionally, you can explore more Pokémon by clicking on the directional arrows, allowing you to view other cards with different abilities.
